# Refactoring Katas

This repository contains my personal practice with **Refactoring Katas**, originally curated by [Emily Bache](https://github.com/emilybache).  

The goal of this work is to improve my skills in:  
- Writing **clean, maintainable code**  
- Practising **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** and refactoring  
- Exploring **design principles** (SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.)  
- Strengthening my ability to deal with **legacy code**

## ðŸ“š About Refactoring Katas
Refactoring Katas are small coding exercises designed to simulate working with messy or legacy code.  
They are meant to be refactored step by step, usually while keeping tests green.
